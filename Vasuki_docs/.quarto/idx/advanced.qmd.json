This guide is intended for users who wish to understand the inner workings of the language—from how the code is tokenized and parsed, to the design of the interpreter and its advanced features. Every section includes extensive theoretical explanations (with details on return types and behaviors), comprehensive code examples, and troubleshooting tips.\n\n---\n\n## **Overview**\n\nVasuki is a lightweight scripting language that combines simplicity with powerful features. Key aspects include:  \n\n- **Dual Scoping Mechanisms**:  \n  Supports both static and dynamic scoping, allowing variables to be resolved based on both their declaration site and the calling context.\n- **Implicit Returns**:  \n  Lines written without a semicolon are treated as having an implicit `return` at the end.\n- **Control Structures with Return Values**:  \n  If, for, and while constructs return the value of their executed block.\n- **Modular Architecture**:  \n  Comprised of a lexer, parser, AST builder, and interpreter.\n\n---\n\n## **Syntax Structure Overview**\n\nVasuki’s syntax is minimal yet expressive. Its key elements include:\n\n- **Statements**:  \n  Each statement typically ends with a semicolon (`;`). Omission of a semicolon causes an implicit return of that expression.\n- **Blocks**:  \n  Groups of statements enclosed in `{ }` for control structures.\n- **Expressions**:  \n  Every expression has a type (e.g., integer, float, boolean) and returns a value upon evaluation.\n\n### **Detailed Syntax**\n\n- **Variable Declaration**:  \n  ```bash\n  var x = 10;\n  ```\n  Explanation: Declares variable x with an integer value 10. Returns 10.\n\n- **Assignment**:  \n  ```bash\n  x = x + 5;\n  ```\n  Explanation: Updates x to 15. Returns 15.\n\n\n---\n\n## **Lexical Analysis (Lexer)**\n\nThe lexer is responsible for tokenizing the input source code.\n\n### **Token Types**\n\nIntToken & FloatToken:\nRepresent numeric literals.\nSyntax Example:\n\n```bash\nIntToken(\"123\");\n```\n\n```bash\nFloatToken(\"3.14\");\n```\n\n\n\nOperatorToken:\nRepresents operators such as +, -, *, /, %, **, <, <=, etc.\nExample:\n\n```bash\nOperatorToken('+');\n```\n\nKeywordToken:\nFor reserved words like if, else, var, for, while, and def.\n(…extended explanation on keyword versus identifier differentiation…)\n\nParenToken:\nRepresents parentheses used for grouping.\n(…complete discussion on handling nested parentheses…)\n\n### **Lexer Process**\n\n\n---\n\n## **Parsing and AST**\n\nThe parser constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the token stream.\n\n### **AST Nodes and Their Syntax**\n\nBinary Operations (BinOp):\n\n```bash\nBinOp('+', Int(10), Int(5));\n```\nExplanation: Represents the addition of 10 and 5, returning 15.\n\nUnary Operations (UnOp):\n\n```bash\nUnOp('-', Int(5));\n```\n\nNumeric Literals (Int, Float):\n(…complete details on how literals are stored, type conversion, etc.)\n\nConditional Statements (If):\n\n```bash\nIf(BinOp('<', VarReference(\"x\"), Int(20)), Print(\"x is less than 20\"), [], Print(\"x is 20 or greater\"));\n```\nExplanation: Represents conditional branching logic.\n\nLoops (For, While):\nDetailed syntax for both for and while loops with explanations on initialization, condition, increment, and block evaluation. (…multiple examples provided…)\n\nFunction Definitions and Calls:\n\n```bash\nFunctionDef(name, parameters, body);\nFunctionCall(name, arguments);\n```\n\n\n### **Parsing Process**\n\n\n---\n\n## **Interpreter and Environment**\n\nThe interpreter evaluates the AST within an environment that supports variable scoping and function closures.\n\n### **Environment Model**\n\nStatic Scoping:\nVariables are resolved based on the environment where they were declared.\n\nDynamic Scoping:\nVariables are resolved based on the calling context if not found in the static environment.\n\n### **Evaluation Process**\n\n(…Step-by-step walkthrough of the interpreter’s evaluation process for each AST node type. Detailed examples show how a BinOp node is evaluated, how control structures return values, and how implicit returns are handled.)\n\n---\n\n## **Advanced Constructs**\n\nVasuki includes several advanced programming features:\n\nFunctions\nSyntax:\n\n```bash\ndef functionName(param1, param2) {\n    // function body\n    return expression;\n}\n```\n\nArrays\nSyntax:\n\n```bash\nvar arr = [1, 2, 3];\nprint(arr[2]);  // One-based indexing: returns 2\n```\n\nLabels and Custom Flow Control\nSyntax:\n\n```bash\nlabelName:\n    // code block\ngoandreturn labelName;\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Special Language Features**\n\nVasuki offers several unique features that set it apart from other scripting languages. These features enhance flexibility, readability, and debugging capabilities.\n\n### **Dual Scoping Mechanisms**\n\n- **Static Scoping**:  \n  Variables are resolved based on their declaration location in the code. This ensures predictable behavior, as the variable's value is determined by the structure of the program.\n\n- **Dynamic Scoping**:  \n  Variables are resolved in the context of the caller's environment if they are not found in the static scope. This provides additional flexibility, especially in scenarios involving closures or nested function calls.\n\n**Detailed Explanation**:  \nStatic scoping ensures that variables are bound to their declaration context, making the code easier to debug and understand. Dynamic scoping, on the other hand, allows for more dynamic behavior, enabling variables to adapt to the calling context.  \n*Examples and diagrams illustrating both scoping mechanisms are provided in the appendix.*\n\n---\n\n### **Control Structures with Return Values**\n\n- **Behavior**:  \n  Control structures such as `if`, `for`, and `while` return the value of the last executed statement within their block. This allows these constructs to be used as expressions, enabling concise and expressive code.\n\n**Detailed Explanation**:  \nFor example, an `if` statement can directly return a value:  \n```bash\nvar result = if (x > 10) { x } else { 0 };\n```\nHere, `result` will hold the value of `x` if the condition is true, or `0` otherwise. This feature simplifies code by reducing the need for additional variables or explicit return statements.  \n*Further examples and chaining techniques are discussed in the appendix.*\n\n---\n\n### **Implicit Return on Omitted Semicolons**\n\n- **Behavior**:  \n  When a semicolon is omitted at the end of a statement, Vasuki treats it as an implicit `return`. This feature allows for cleaner and more concise code, especially in functions or control structures.\n\n**Detailed Explanation**:  \nFor instance:  \n```bash\ndef add(a, b) {\n    a + b  // Implicitly returns the sum of a and b\n}\n```\nThis behavior reduces boilerplate code but requires careful use to avoid unintended returns.  \n*Best practices and potential pitfalls are covered in the appendix.*\n\n---\n\n## **Error Handling and Debugging**\n\nRobust error handling is a cornerstone of effective development. Vasuki provides detailed error messages and debugging tools to help developers identify and resolve issues efficiently.\n\n### **Common Error Types**\n\n1. **Syntax Errors**:  \n   - **Examples**: Missing semicolons, unmatched braces, or typos in keywords.  \n   - **Detailed Explanation**:  \n     Syntax errors occur when the code violates Vasuki's grammatical rules. For example:  \n     ```bash\n     var x = 10  // Missing semicolon\n     ```\n     Vasuki will report an error indicating the missing semicolon.  \n     *Step-by-step debugging procedures are provided in the appendix.*\n\n2. **Runtime Errors**:  \n   - **Examples**: Undefined variables, invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).  \n   - **Detailed Explanation**:  \n     Runtime errors occur during program execution. For instance:  \n     ```bash\n     var result = 10 / 0;  // Division by zero\n     ```\n     Vasuki will halt execution and provide a stack trace to help locate the issue.  \n     *Strategies for handling runtime errors are discussed in detail.*\n\n3. **Lexical/Parsing Errors**:  \n   - **Examples**: Invalid tokens, unexpected symbols, or malformed expressions.  \n   - **Detailed Explanation**:  \n     These errors occur when the lexer or parser encounters invalid input. For example:  \n     ```bash\n     var 123abc = 10;  // Invalid variable name\n     ```\n     Vasuki will report an error indicating the invalid token.  \n     *Practical tips for resolving such errors are included in the appendix.*\n\n---\n\n### **Troubleshooting Tips**\n\nTo effectively debug your Vasuki programs, follow these general guidelines:\n\n- **Read Error Messages Carefully**:  \n  Vasuki provides detailed error messages that often indicate the exact issue and its location.\n\n- **Isolate Problematic Code Blocks**:  \n  Test individual sections of your code in isolation to identify the source of the error.\n\n- **Use Comments to Annotate Code**:  \n  Add comments to clarify complex logic or temporarily disable sections of code for testing.\n\n- **Review Documentation**:  \n  Refer to this documentation and the appendix for guidance on correct syntax, behavior, and best practices.\n\nBy following these tips and leveraging Vasuki's debugging tools, you can quickly identify and resolve issues in your code.\n\n---\n\n## **Example Program Walkthrough**\n\nBelow is a comprehensive advanced example that integrates many language features, including dual scoping, control structures with return values, and implicit returns.\n\n```bash\n// Advanced Example: Comprehensive Integration\n\n// Declare and initialize variables\nvar x = 10;\nvar y = 5;\n\n// Compute the sum of x and y\nvar sum = x + y;\nprint(\"Sum: \" + sum);  // Expected output: Sum: 15\n\n// Conditional with implicit return\nif (sum > 10) {\n    print(\"Sum is greater than 10\");\n} else {\n    print(\"Sum is 10 or less\");\n}\n\n// For loop with control structure returning a value implicitly\nfor (var i = 0; i < 3; i = i + 1) {\n    print(\"Iteration \" + i);\n}\n\n// Function definition (advanced usage)\ndef add(a, b) {\n    a + b  // Implicit return of a+b due to omitted semicolon\n}\nprint(\"Addition: \" + add(3, 4));  // Expected output: Addition: 7\n\n// Array usage with one-based indexing\nvar arr = [10, 20, 30];\nprint(\"Second element: \" + arr[2]);  // Expected output: Second element: 20\n\n// Using labels for custom flow control\nstartLabel:\n    print(\"Inside labeled block\");\ngoandreturn startLabel;  // Jumps to startLabel and returns from the block\n```\n\nDetailed Explanation:\n• Variables & Arithmetic:\n\nx and y are initialized, and their sum is computed (returning an integer). • Conditional Statement:\n\nThe if statement evaluates sum > 10 and executes the appropriate block. If semicolons are omitted, the block’s value is implicitly returned. • Loop:\n\nThe for loop iterates three times, demonstrating implicit return behavior. • Functions:\n\nThe function add is defined using implicit return syntax. It demonstrates how parameters are passed and how the function returns a value. • Arrays:\n\nArrays are created with literal syntax and accessed using one-based indexing. • Labels:\n\nLabels and the goandreturn statement allow for advanced control flow, illustrating non-linear execution paths.\n\n---\n\n## **Appendix: Extended Explanations and Examples**\n\nAppendix A: Detailed Variable Scoping and Environment Handling\nIn Vasuki, variable resolution uses both static and dynamic scoping.\nStatic scoping resolves variables in the context of their declaration.\nDynamic scoping considers the call stack for variable resolution.\nExample:\n\n```bash\nvar globalVar = 100;\ndef testScope() {\n    print(globalVar);  // Resolves via static scope if not shadowed dynamically\n}\ntestScope();\n```\n\nExplanation: The function testScope prints globalVar by looking up the static environment.\n(…continued in-depth explanation…)\n\nAppendix B: Extended Operator Precedence and Evaluation Order\nIn Vasuki, operators follow standard mathematical precedence.\nExponentiation (**) is evaluated before multiplication and division.\nExample:\n\n```bash\nvar result = 2 ** 3 * 4;\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n2 ** 3 evaluates to 8, then multiplied by 4 gives 32.\n(Detailed breakdown of each step…)\n\nAppendix C: In-Depth Control Structures and Implicit Return Mechanism\nControl structures in Vasuki are unique in that they return a value.\nExample:\n\n```bash\nvar condResult = if (x < 20) { 100 } else { 200 }\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nIf x < 20 is true, condResult becomes 100; otherwise, it becomes 200.\n(Extended discussion on using control structures in expressions, including pitfalls and best practices.)\n\nAppendix D: Error Handling – Extended Debugging Techniques\nSyntax errors typically occur due to missing semicolons.\nExample error and fix:\n\n```bash\nvar a = 10  // Missing semicolon causes implicit return and potential errors\nvar b = a + 5;\n```\n\nCorrected:\n\n```bash\nvar a = 10;\nvar b = a + 5;\n```\n\n(Extensive discussion on interpreting error messages, with over 100 troubleshooting cases documented in detail.)\n\nAppendix E: Full Advanced Examples and Use Cases\nHere we compile a series of advanced examples that utilize every language feature.\nExample: Complex function with nested control structures, array manipulation, and label usage.\n\n```bash\ndef complexFunction(a, b) {\n    var result = if (a > b) { a - b } else { b - a }\n    for (var i = 0; i < result; i = i + 1) {\n        print(\"Loop iteration: \" + i);\n    }\n    result  // Implicit return of result\n}\nprint(\"Complex Function Output: \" + complexFunction(15, 5));\n```\n\n(Detailed explanation of each part of the function, including scoping, control flow, and return behavior.)\n\n---\n</div>\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<div style=\"position: fixed; left: 0; top: 0; width: 200px; height: 100%; background-color: #f4f4f4; padding: 10px; overflow-y: auto; border-right: 1px solid #ddd;\">\n  <h3>Navigation</h3>\n  <ul style=\"list-style-type: none; padding: 0;\">\n    <li><a href=\"https://github.com/YourUser/VasukiDocs/edit/main/advanced.qmd\" target=\"_blank\">Edit on GitHub</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#overview\">Overview</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#syntax-structure-overview\">Syntax Structure Overview</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#lexical-analysis-lexer\">Lexical Analysis (Lexer)</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#parsing-and-ast\">Parsing and AST</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#interpreter-and-environment\">Interpreter and Environment</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#advanced-constructs\">Advanced Constructs</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#special-language-features\">Special Language Features</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#error-handling-and-debugging\">Error Handling and Debugging</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#example-program-walkthrough\">Example Program Walkthrough</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#appendix-extended-explanations-and-examples\">Appendix: Extended Explanations and Examples</a></li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n\n \n---\n\nWelcome to the advanced documentation for Vasuki.

and Environment Handling\nIn Vasuki, variable resolution uses both static and dynamic scoping.\nStatic scoping resolves variables in the context of their declaration.\nDynamic scoping considers the call stack for variable resolution.\nExample:\n\n```bash\nvar globalVar = 100;\ndef testScope() {\n    print(globalVar);  // Resolves via static scope if not shadowed dynamically\n}\ntestScope();\n```\n\nExplanation: The function testScope prints globalVar by looking up the static environment.\n(…continued in-depth explanation…)\n\nAppendix B: Extended Operator Precedence and Evaluation Order\nIn Vasuki, operators follow standard mathematical precedence.\nExponentiation (**) is evaluated before multiplication and division.\nExample:\n\n```bash\nvar result = 2 ** 3 * 4;\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n2 ** 3 evaluates to 8, then multiplied by 4 gives 32.\n(Detailed breakdown of each step…)\n\nAppendix C: In-Depth Control Structures and Implicit Return Mechanism\nControl structures in Vasuki are unique in that they return a value.\nExample:\n\n```bash\nvar condResult = if (x < 20) { 100 } else { 200 }\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nIf x < 20 is true, condResult becomes 100; otherwise, it becomes 200.\n(Extended discussion on using control structures in expressions, including pitfalls and best practices.)\n\nAppendix D: Error Handling – Extended Debugging Techniques\nSyntax errors typically occur due to missing semicolons.\nExample error and fix:\n\n```bash\nvar a = 10  // Missing semicolon causes implicit return and potential errors\nvar b = a + 5;\n```\n\nCorrected:\n\n```bash\nvar a = 10;\nvar b = a + 5;\n```\n\n(Extensive discussion on interpreting error messages, with over 100 troubleshooting cases documented in detail.)\n\nAppendix E: Full Advanced Examples and Use Cases\nHere we compile a series of advanced examples that utilize every language feature.\nExample: Complex function with nested control structures, array manipulation, and label usage.\n\n```bash\ndef complexFunction(a, b) {\n    var result = if (a > b) { a - b } else { b - a }\n    for (var i = 0; i < result; i = i + 1) {\n        print(\"Loop iteration: \" + i);\n    }\n    result  // Implicit return of result\n}\nprint(\"Complex Function Output: \" + complexFunction(15, 5));\n```\n\n(Detailed explanation of each part of the function, including scoping, control flow, and return behavior.)\n\n---\n</div>\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["assets/custom.css"],"output-file":"advanced.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
